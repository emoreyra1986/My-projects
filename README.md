# My-projects
Everything I created since my learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In the root folder you can see my first website. This is something like a HelloWorld project.
In the other folders you'll see the exersices I am making through the books I already have in my home library.
Just take a look and you'll see my progress day by day.
